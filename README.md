**Build**: Vite, Node.js  
**Deployment**: Docker-ready

## üéØ Core Principles Followed

- ‚úÖ **ENHANCEMENT FIRST**: Extended existing components vs creating new ones
- ‚úÖ **AGGRESSIVE CONSOLIDATION**: Single LeePerry class handles face processing
- ‚úÖ **PREVENT BLOAT**: Removed redundant systems, consolidated functionality
- ‚úÖ **DRY**: Single source of truth for medical conditions and processing logic
- ‚úÖ **CLEAN**: Clear separation between 3D rendering, AI processing, and UI
- ‚úÖ **MODULAR**: Independent, testable components with explicit dependencies
- ‚úÖ **PERFORMANT**: Progressive loading, efficient texture management, caching

## üéÆ User Experience

1. **Upload Face**: Click "Upload Face" ‚Üí AI processes and applies to 3D model
2. **X-Ray Scan**: Move mouse to control X-ray scanning area
3. **Medical Analysis**: Press `[C]` to show condition markers ‚Üí Click for AI diagnosis
4. **Expand View**: Press `[E]` for full X-ray expansion effect

## üß† AI Integration Details

### Cerebras Implementation

```typescript
// Real-time medical analysis with streaming responses
const response = await fetch("https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/chat/completions", {
  model: "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Analyze ${condition.name} for medical education...`,
    },
  ],
  stream: true,
  reasoning_effort: "medium",
});
```

### Enhanced Cerebras Features

```typescript
// Structured JSON outputs with confidence scoring
const response = await fetch("https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/chat/completions", {
  model: "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Analyze this case..." }],
  response_format: {
    type: "json_schema",
    json_schema: DIAGNOSTIC_ANALYSIS_SCHEMA,
  },
});

// Tool use for medical calculations
const response = await fetch("https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/chat/completions", {
  model: "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Calculate CHADS2 score..." }],
  tools: [medical_calculation_tools],
});
```
